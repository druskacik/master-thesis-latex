The thesis discusses the topic of bankruptcy prediction with emphasis on Slovak firms.
The main result of the thesis includes three logistic regression models whose objective is the assessment of the financial condition of the Slovak firms.
Besides aiming for the prediction ability the thesis puts emphasis also on the interpretability of the individual models.
We employ two methods for the selection of model variables – \emph{lasso} (\emph{least absolute shrinkage and selection operator}) and \emph{BACE} (\emph{Bayesian averaging of classical estimates}).
The analysis of results indicates that the latter is suitable in situations where the great emphasis is put on the interpretability and understandability of the results.
Model comparision in the last section indicates that the models from the thesis have better prediction ability in the
Slovak environment than other well-known credit risk models, Altman’s Z-score and index IN05.
